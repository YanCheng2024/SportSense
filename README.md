# Context-Aware Deep Learning for Action Recognition in Team Sports

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a novel deep learning framework for **action recognition in team sports**, integrating the **Spatiotemporal Action Dynamics Encoder (STADE)** and **Context-Aware Spatiotemporal Adaptation (CASTA)**. Our method improves robustness and accuracy by effectively modeling both **spatiotemporal dependencies** and **contextual factors** within dynamic sports environments.

## Features

- **Spatiotemporal Action Dynamics Encoder (STADE)**: Hybrid mechanism combining temporal modeling with spatial attention.
- **Context-Aware Spatiotemporal Adaptation (CASTA)**: Dynamically adjusts feature importance based on scene-specific priors.
- **Multimodal Data Processing**: Supports video, sensor, and contextual inputs for comprehensive action recognition.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Outperforms traditional CNN and RNN-based methods on multiple benchmark datasets.
- **Scalability & Robustness**: Generalizes across different sports and dynamic environments.
